In this assignment, I had the opportunity to create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

__Background/Scenario__
"You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance."

__Final Analysis__
The dataset reveals several noteworthy findings. PyCity comprises 15 schools with an approximate student population of 40,000 and a total budget of $24,649,428. Notably, on average, students in PyCity tend to perform better in reading compared to math, with roughly 65 percent of students passing both subjects. The data also highlights a greater prevalence of Charter-type schools compared to District-type schools, reflecting the diversity within the city's educational landscape. Bailey High School stands out as the most populous school, while Huang High School demonstrates the highest per capita spending.

Moreover, Cabrera High School emerges as the highest-performing institution in the dataset, while Rodriguez High School exhibits the lowest performance. Intriguingly, a trend surfaces, indicating that larger schools and District schools generally report lower percentages of overall passing scores. This finding raises questions and suggests potential areas that warrant further investigation within the PyCity educational system.
